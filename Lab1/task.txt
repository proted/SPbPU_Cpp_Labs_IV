Member of the Technical Committee "Road Safety" under Rosstandart, deputy. Committee of classic cars of the Russian Automobile Federation Peter Shlyakhin explained that at the moment it is necessary to develop technical conditions for the application of GOST "We need drawings with more precise parameters - for example, the distance between the symbols. I am sure that they will be developed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs before January 1. After that, the Ministry of Internal Affairs will begin purchasing new numbers from manufacturers at tenders. This is usually handled by a special police structure - the Special Purpose Center for Road Safety. But first we need to exhaust the stocks of old format numbers, this may take several months, "Shlyakhin explained.
